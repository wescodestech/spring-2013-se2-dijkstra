		comment: Tested network connectvity for ACL2 using various methods.  Found that through file streaming, we could transfer files through connected network drives.  We are not able to connect to a specific TCP/IP address or anything without a directory resolution on the network.  Example: \\MatthewCrist-Laptop would work, \\127.0.0.1 would work, but http://127.0.0.1 or \\127.0.0.1:80 would not yeild results.  I have determined that either we will need supplemental language in order to make the transfer or map network drives.

		comment: Researched event handling in ACL2 from previous project regarding "Blue Ball" scenario.  Determined that this could be used to implement the client side gestures for the chat messages to be sent and received.  Also noted that the primitive nature of the interface would require that we construct many of the GUI element ourselves.  I think we should be able to assign functions to these events to read and write files where necessary.

Worked with Matthew to re-write sections of the proposal to include the new ideas for the project and write out the requirements for the project. The new project will be an email system instead of a chat system, with more emphasis on message delivery and content.

		comment: After discussion with Rex Page regarding some of the features of ACL2, he described to us that ACL2 cannot use a GUI and write/read from files at the same time.  This has thrown us in a tizzy about writing a chat client.  After reassessment of the situation, we determined that we could salvage much of the information that we derived in previous sessions by using supplemental language, such as C to write the server and client interfaces that would invoke ACL2 executables on demand and have these applications handle the events for both client and server processes.  We could use folder monitoring on server side and invoke those modules that are created adding to the modularity of the application itself.  Isaac, Wes and I rewrote the design document so that it would be available for Thursday (January 31, 2013) for the presentation.  We also determined that Adam should be the one to give the overview of the application since he may want the extra speaking opportunity.

		comment: Attempted to get Proofpad to function on my windows PC (Microsoft Windows 8) to no success.  Attempted to get it to work on my Linux partition as well (Ubuntu 11.04 LTS) with no such luck either.  Both result in NullPointerExceptions being tossed back by the application itself.  Unable to invoke ACL2 internally as a result.  Decided to do some testing with ACL2 command line and get familiar with the environment  Noticed that the teachpacks were not certified for io-utilities.lisp and list-utilities.lisp, so I had to include them in a subfolder and include them in the file directly.  Cannot use program mode in ACL2 and have to stay in logic mode else the files will not include correctly into the project.  Considering DrRacket as the IDE for development as a result.

		comment: Started to develop the infrastructure for the server monitor program.  Determined that the use of processes and a dependency relationship was necessary to ensure that a process was complete before invoking a dependent processes.  Derived an XML DTD for the input format to load modules into the server environment for invocation.  Assigned names to modules in the format (program).(content).(action) naming convention, a folder to monitor for files, and a process to invoke when a file is detected.  Information has been updated on the wiki for reference on module creation under >> The Server Monitor.

		comment: Did some more work on the Server Monitor.  Wrote threading for directory monitoring and process invocation.  Have not tied module invocation directly to program yet, as I need to verify that executables can be effectively created from Racket.  File size seems to be rather large at the moment for just a hand full of code.  May consider an alternative approach.

	  comment: Matthew emailed about an issue with the ACL2 EXE's not working correctly and possibly being unable once the project gets large. Spent this time researching how to move the project to UNIX based servers and working with launching ACL2 from the terminal and using shell scripts to call ACL2 lisp files.

		comment: Determined that executables in ACL2 is not a practical solution.  Tried invocations through redirection on the input method for ACL2 since the executable did not take any arguments.  So far I have had success.  Module invocation can occur through a shell script which does not require dependency checks (which will allow for linear execution.)  Reassessing the use of unsynchronized process invocation.  Perhaps synchronizing the main processing thread to halt while a process is running could be the best alternative.  Invocation of a shell script also alleviates the overhead that may have been involved and we can implement some of the operating system features to transfer information (such as ftp for file transfer).

		comment: Wrote scanner portion for the analyzer for XML content that can be parsed with ACL2.  Added consume, tag, pcData, nextToken, and tokenizeXML functions.  Entry point is tokenizeXML which takes a string of XML and will return a list of tokens and the token type.  This should then be added to a stack to verify xml correctness and can then be used to extract the PCDATA information contained between the brackets.

	  comment: I re-worked the file IO functions to accommodate the requirements of the IO utilities functions. This fixed the majority of the admission issues for these functions. Still the getEmail and runEmail functions are the global execution functions still have work needed to get them to admit and run with ACL2.

		comment: Starting in the development of the network connectivity subsystem that will allow for the transmission of information across a network via IP address.  Determined previously that the "nc" command in UNIX was sufficient in order to accomplish this task  Proceeded to decompose the component and derived the need for a separate "method invocation" language.

		comment: Proceeded to develop a rough draft for the diagram that would be formalized into the design document for network connectivity.  Upon further investigation, I realized that I need to find a way in order to send a request to the server to open a sending port after the client has acknowledged opening a recieving port for data transmission.  This appears to be the most difficult scenario for the server to overcome.

Being that both Adam and Isaac were gone, Wes and I have had to develop a plan of action toward pushing for project completion.  RMI has been temporarily placed on hold until we can solve these issues.  Perhaps and explanation of the RAD process and a bit of motivation would be the route to go.  Designed a flow chart for an overview of the basic functionality and what components were complete.  Decided that I would give the presentation on the update of the status of the project.

Instead of developing this as a module, I have decided to place this in the "includes" folder since it would more than likely be used by other modules.  Point of entry is getActions function which would return a data structure of actions that will be updated in the next design document.  On a side note, we can use this for user authentication where required instead of a separate request for authentication.

		comment: Continued development on the RMI language interpreter.  Developed last few functions getActionString, getAction.  Brackets encapsulate the actions, and semicolins separate the actions.  SERVERACTION denotes a server action to take place.  CLIENTACTION denotes that a client action should take place.  At the time of this file conception, MOVEFILE and COPYFILE actions are only considered.  The portion containing the string between the brackets is the module that will be considered.  This will acquire the "monitor" value from the module registration on the server side.  In otherwords, the file that contains the "header" information will be MOVED/COPIED (depending on action) to the monitor for the module that is in the brackets, thus invoking the monitor process and kick starting the module itself.  Files that contain monitor information will end with a file extension of $unix_timestamp.rmi.  When this file is copied, the header information is removed and the output is the following XML that is contained in the file ($unix_timestamp.xml).

	 comment: We discovered that generating ALC2 executables and invoking these files from an outside source is a troublesome experience and that the generated files are hundreds of megabytes in size. Since we will have several modules for this project, we saw this as a negative side effect of executable files. To solve this problem, we moved all our project to the UNIX platform. This has allowed us to use the UNIX shell environment to generate shell scripts that invoke the ACL2 environment while passing in ACL2 source code files. This reduces the size of the files to kilobytes and streamlines the execution process and eliminating the size of outside programming needed for the original idea to work. Thus we will be executing our ACL2 code through a UNIX shell script and the shell scripts will in turn be executed from the outside programming environment.

CHMOD properties will need to be determined at a different date, since access to store files has not been completely determined.  Best guess is that server will be the only one that needs read/write access to these files and no user group will need execution access.

Determine that it was an issue that the directories did not exist, thus the information was not being written properly by the ACL2 script, which was a difficult thing to determine since acquiring error information from the runtime environment would only be possible if we wrote the error to an output log.
