	 comment: Worked on researching networking from within ACL2. There is not any native support for networking. However, we did discover that we could use networking if the Operating System supports it. Since our operating systems can be networked, we can work around this limitation.

	 comment: Team Dijkstra's regular meeting time. Dr. Page addressed concerns about the Project and that GUI's and File IO cannot exist in the same ACL2 program. We began a major re-design of the project and re-wrote most of the project requirements that are to be included in the proposal.

	  comment: Found out that some of the components of the original proposal were not feasible. Worked with Matthew to re-write sections of the proposal to include the new ideas for the project and write out the requirements for the project. The new project will be an email system instead of a chat system, with more emphasis on message delivery and content.

	  comment: I worked on the ACL2 implementation of the server-email functions and finished the implementation of the components. The functions did not admit correctly and the details are described in the defect log. The issues were traced to file IO so we are still able to run and test the computational functions.

	  comment: I re-worked the file IO functions to accommodate the requirements of the IO utilities functions. This fixed the majority of the admission issues for these functions. Still the getEmail and runEmail functions are the global execution functions still have work needed to get them to admit and run with ACL2.

	  comment: Team Dijkstra's regular meeting time. We worked on server implementation and fixed issues with the server-email file. We split it into two files where one contained the IO functions and the other contained the logic functions. This was done in order to make proving theorems in ACL2 easier.

	  comment: Worked on updating rwEmail. I changed the output file from being solely passed in by the parameters to where only a timestamp is required. The output directory is now dynamically generated to pull the <to> tag from the XML and outputs to output each email message into a directory based on the contents of the tag and the naming convention that was implemented earlier for each individual file.

	  comment: Worked on the client code for the email module. I wrote the functions to parse strings into XML files for outgoing messages.

Ensured that the correct functions were called, and returned the correct structures. This is set up for writing the theorems for this module. Also added the getHTMLtext to the client logic to allow an HTML file to formed and written instead of regular plain text for a nicer looking output.

	  comment: Worked on the theorem suite for the client email module. The theorems are used to test the data integrity of the logic functions in the client. We were unable to test the IO functions with theorems since they rely on variant data. However, the logic could be tested using theorems and we were able to prove that the client email logic module returns the correctly formatted data based on correct input.

	- date: Jan 22, 2013
	  type: Design
	  fix time: 60
	  comment: Found out that networking is not feasible from within ACL2. To make it natively supported, writing and extending several Common Lisp features would need to be done. We cannot do this in the scope of this project. So we found that using the Operating System's native filesystem and networking support would be much more friendly to deal with once we get to this stage in the project.

	 comment: Found out that GUI's and File IO cannot coexist in ACL2. We can have one or the other, but not both. So we had to scrap the GUI portions of the project and replace them with a new idea. The new idea is the current design of the email server and client system. This project is strictly data processing and file IO. This project will be file and text based rather than Visual and Interactive.

	 comment: We discovered that generating ALC2 executables and invoking these files from an outside source is a troublesome experience and that the generated files are hundreds of megabytes in size. Since we will have several modules for this project, we saw this as a negative side effect of executable files. To solve this problem, we moved all our project to the UNIX platform. This has allowed us to use the UNIX shell environment to generate shell scripts that invoke the ACL2 environment while passing in ACL2 source code files. This reduces the size of the files to kilobytes and streamlines the execution process and eliminating the size of outside programming needed for the original idea to work. Thus we will be executing our ACL2 code through a UNIX shell script and the shell scripts will in turn be executed from the outside programming environment.

	 comment: After finishing coding the ACL2 functions, the functions would not admit under normal ACL2 invocation. However, it did work under Dr Racket. The issue was traced to the IO and List utilities files as they were un-certified files within the regular ACL2 environment. Adding the suppression to the certification requirement, the files worked as usual.

	 comment: After fixing the certification issue. Certain functions were still not admitting to ACL2. This was due to illegal arguments as the ACL2 output stated. To fix these arguments, the state variable had to be set and implemented differently than I had intended. I added some safe guards to the variables and added constraints to the functions that depended on them.

	comment: After finishing the IO entry point function on the server email module, We noticed that the XML files were being generated with a comma instead of the @ symbol between names and domains in the email address.

	comment: Working on integrating the ALC2 with Java. Having trouble getting Java to see the files that ACL2 has generated. Right now, the current solution is to make the Java sleep for a couple of seconds while ACL2 finishes its processing then resume. Then it sees the files that ALC2 generates
