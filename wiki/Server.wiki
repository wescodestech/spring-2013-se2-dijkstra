#summary The Server manages the transmission of information and security associated with it.

= Introduction =

The server program for this application manages the transmission of the data and the security surrounding that information.  It will register users for accounts as well as maintain a store for messages that have yet to be received by the user.  It will also store log in credentials for each user and maintain a set of mailing lists that users can subscribe to for mass emailing.


= Details =

The server currently consists of 3 modules:
  * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerUser The User Module]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerEmail The Email Module]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerMailingList The Mailing List Module]

Each module contains actions that can be performed on that module:
  * The User Module
    * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerUserRegister Register User]
    * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerUserVerify Verify User]
  * The Email Module
    * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerEmailSend Send Email]
  * The Mailing List Module
    * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerMailingListCreate Create Mailing List]
    * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerMailingListSubscribe Subscribe to Mailing List]
    * [https://code.google.com/p/spring-2013-se2-dijkstra/wiki/ServerMailingListSend Send to Mailing List]

The server program also requires a number of ports to not be in use.  These include ports 20001-20010.  If these ports are being used, some of the functionality of the server will be compromised.

Current Port Assignment:
  * *20001* - User Registration
  * *20002* - User Verification
  * *20005* - Send EMail
